# Nobel
Coding challenge 
This is a Nobel Coding Project Using Multiple Linear Regression .
In this project I will use a dataset of my own choosing. The dataset can be found on https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html.
It is Sklearn's internal datasets.

# USE CASE
We are able to make predictions based on certain features like AGE , BMI etc. the progression of diabetes for patients. Thereby improving diagnosis and health care.
